## Remembered Fortunes
You can think of this as an early version of my adaptive learning model, specifically the "adaptive" portion before I added Naive Bayes and Decision Trees.

## Output
~~~
First fortune: :- discontiguous purecolor/3. Second fortune: colortint(lightred, colortint).
>> These outcomes are not similar and thus must be unconnected...
First fortune: % basic toned versions of colors Second fortune: colorshade(darkgreen, colorshade).
>> These outcomes are not similar and thus must be unconnected...
First fortune: colortint(lightblue, colortint). Second fortune: placeholder
>> These outcomes are not similar and thus must be unconnected...
First fortune: colortint(midblue, colortone). Second fortune: % basic toned versions of colors
>> These outcomes are not similar and thus must be unconnected...
First fortune: colortint(midblue, colortone). Second fortune: White
>> These outcomes are not similar and thus must be unconnected...
First fortune: colortint(lightblue, colortint). Second fortune: colortint(lightblue, colortint).
>> These outcomes are similar and thus remembering these for later...
